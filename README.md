# Portfolio Website
This project showcases my data science roadmap and projects on a deployed website.

## Project Motivation
I wanted to have a space to showcase my projects with references to their code, blog posts and deployed apps, where applicable. I also added more details about my learning path towards data science and the skills I acquired.

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
This code can be used under the [MIT license](#). I created this website completely from scratch, therefore I am the author of the code, including certain references and code snippets from other people. Feel free use the code - but remove any of the content relating to me - to create your own portfolio website.
